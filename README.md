# bus-stations

Buses run between the western villages. Since the passenger traffic here is not very large, the buses run only a few times a day.
One man needs to get from village d to village v as quickly as possible (it is assumed that at time 0 he is in village d).

First, the number N is entered, the total number of villages, then the village numbers d and v, followed by the number of bus trips R. The following are descriptions of bus routes. Each flight is given by the departure village number, departure time, destination village and arrival time (all times are integers). If at time t a passenger arrives at some village, then he can leave it at any time starting from t.

Print the minimum time when he can be in the village v. If he can't get from d to v using the specified bus routes, print âˆ’1.
